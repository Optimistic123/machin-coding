# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

Observing the List
Here, you treat the list as the scrollable container itself. This approach works when:
1. The entire list is responsible for scrolling.
2. There is no parent container or additional content outside the list.

When Should You Observe the Container?
You should observe the container if:
 1. The container manages scrolling, and the list is just one part of the content.
 2. You need additional flexibility, such as headers, footers, or unrelated components outside the list.

When Should You Observe the List?
You should observe the list if:
1. The list itself is scrollable (no parent container managing scroll).
2. The list is self-contained, with no additional content (e.g., a footer) outside the scrollable area.

Why Set the Total Height?
1. Scroll Behavior and Space Allocation:
   By setting the height of the inner container, you ensure the browser allocates the necessary scrollable space for the full list.
   Without this height, the browser wouldnâ€™t know how much space to reserve, and the scrollbar might not appear or work properly.
2. Accurate Scroll Position:
   With a defined height, the scrollTop of the container directly maps to where the visible items should be within the total list.
   This simplifies calculating the indices of visible items (startIndex and endIndex).
3. Improved Performance with Smooth Scrolling:
   A pre-defined height ensures smooth scrolling because the browser knows how much content to "virtually" accommodate.
